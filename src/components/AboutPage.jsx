          <p className="text-content">
            Nevada's Safe Harbor Law (NRS 603A) provides legal protection for businesses that implement and
            maintain strong cybersecurity controls aligned with nationally recognized standards, like the CIS
            Controls.
          </p>
          <h3 className="subsection-title">Why It Matters to You:</h3>
          <ul className="list-content">
            <li>If a data breach occurs, businesses that meet Safe Harbor standards can reduce or eliminate liability for damages.</li>
            <li>It's a defensible shield for executives and boards — proof that your organization took reasonable steps to protect data.</li>
            <li>Safe Harbor isn't optional; it's smart risk management and part of your legal strategy to avoid lawsuits and penalties.</li>
          </ul>
